Tank - Creative Portfolio Showcase HTML Website Template

Changelog

======================
Updating information:
======================

Explanation: Because of the nature of the HTML, it is not possible to use dynamic features to update the template automatically. All code changes and updates must be made manually!

IMPORTANT!: Before you proceed to update, make sure that you have made copies of all the template files, 
in case something goes wrong then you can restore the previous version.

The best way to update the template is to use some file comparison software to compare the differences between the old and new template versions (I recommend “WinMerge”: http://winmerge.org/). Then make the necessary changes. I know this may be time-consuming, but unfortunately, there is no easier solution.
